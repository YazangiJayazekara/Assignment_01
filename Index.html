        <h1><b>Our Story</b></h1>
        <p>
        In 1844 British businessman William Milne started ‘Milne & Company', general warehousemen, importers of oilman stores etc, with branches in Kandy and Galle. 
        In 1850 Milne was joined by his friend, David Sime Cargill, and the firm became ‘Milne, Cargill & Co'.
        In 1860 Milne retired from business in Ceylon and moved back to Scotland to form a company in Glasgow to look after the business of Cargill & Co. in the UK. 
        Cargill became the sole partner until he was joined by David MacKenzie and the name was changed to ‘Cargill & Co’. The company had a Colombo office at the intersection of Price and York Streets in Colombo Fort, a Kandy office at Upper Lake Road and an office in Galle Fort at 22 Pedlar Street. 
        The Galle office was closed down in 1863. In 1890 the business expanded with the purchase of 'Medical Hall,’ a chemist and druggist company. 
        Cargills also established another company, ‘Sime & Co.’, which sold lower quality goods. In 1896 Cargill & Co. was converted into a Limited Liability Company registered in Glasgow. 
        Two years later, the company bought James McLaren &Co.’s business in Nuwara Eliya, establishing a branch there. <br>
        In 1981 Ceylon Theatres acquired a controlling interest in the company and Albert A. Page was appointed the Managing Director. 
        Page went on to become the Chairman of Cargills on 26 November 1982.Under the new management, Cargills explored the potential of innovating on its trading legacy. 
        As a result, in 1983 Cargills established the first supermarket chain in Sri Lanka with the opening of its first outlet at Staple Street "<b><i>On your way home</i></b>". Cargills ventured into the production of processed meats in 1993 when the Company invested in its first manufacturing facility, Cargills Quality Foods, in Mattakkuliya.
         For now, our retail footprint has reached over 425 stores covering all 25 district of Sri Lanka.
